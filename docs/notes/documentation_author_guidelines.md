# Guidelines for writing workflows

## Make no assumptions on the user
- Nothing is obvious to somebody who doesn't know

## How to know if the process worked
- Add sections explaining how to verify that the process completed successfully

## Have a trouble-shooting procedure
- One approach is to always start from scratch
