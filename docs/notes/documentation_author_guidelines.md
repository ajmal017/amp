# Guidelines for writing workflows

## Make no assumptions on the user
- Nothing is obvious to somebody who doesn't know

## How to know if the process worked
- Add sections explaining how to verify that the process completed successfully

## Have a trouble-shooting procedure
- One approach is to always start from scratch

# Style and cosmetic lints

## Empty line after heading
- Leave an empty line after an heading to make it more visible
    ```

    # Very important title

    - Not really
    ```

## Style for numbered lists
- We use number lists like:
    ```
    1. Foo bar!
        - hello
        - world
        
    2. Baz
    ```

# The team member list
- In reversed alphabetical order (just to be fair)
    - [ ] Stas
    - [ ] Sonya
    - [ ] Sergey
    - [ ] Paul
    - [ ] Liza
    - [ ] Julia
    - [ ] GP
