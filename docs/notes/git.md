# Workflow

1. Run `git fetch`
    ```bash
    # Fetch all the data from origin.
    > git fetch
    # List all the branches.
    > git branch -r
      origin/HEAD -> origin/master
      origin/PartTask274
      ...
    ```

2. Checkout `master` and `pull`

    - You want to branch from the latest version of master to avoid a merge:
        ```bash
        # Checkout the `master` branch.
        > git checkout master
        # Make sure your local `master` is in sync with the remote.
        > git pull --rebase
        ```
    - Alternatively, and especially if you have local changes to move to a new
      branch, run
        ```bash
        > git checkout master
        > gup.py
        ```
      instead.

3. Name a branch after its corresponding issue
    - The canonical name for a new feature branch is obtained by running
      `ghi_show.py`:
        ```bash
        > ghi_show.py 274 --only_github
        > ghi_show.py 274 -r ParticleDev/commodity_research --only_github
        # Github:
        #274: PRICE: Download equity data
        https://github.com/alphamatic/lemonade/issues/274

        # Tag:
        LemTask274_PRICE_Download_equity_data
        ```
    - The name is `LemTask274_PRICE_Download_equity_data`
    - To use multiple branches for a given task, append a numeral to the name,
      e.g., `LemTask274_PRICE_Download_equity_data_02`

4. Create and checkout the branch
    - Create and checkout a branch
        ```bash
        > git branch my_feature
        > git checkout my_feature
        ```
    - Alternatively, you can create and checkout in one command with:
        ```bash
        > git checkout -b my_feature
        ```
    - From this point on, you commit only in the branch and changes to master
      will not affect your branch
    - If the branch already exists, check out the branch by executing
       ```bash
       > git checkout my_feature
       ```

5. Commit your work **early and often**

    - Commits on your feature branch do not affect `master`. Checkpoint your work
    regularly by committing:
        ```bash
        > git status
        On branch my-feature
        ...

        > git add ...

        > git commit
        [my-feature 820b296] My feature is awesome!
        ```
    - Commits stay local (not seen on GitHub) until you explicitly tell git to
      "upload" the commits through `git push` (see next)

6. Push your feature branch changes upstream

    - When you commit, commits are local (not seen on GitHub)

    - When you want your code to be pushed to the server (e.g., to back up or to
      share the changes with someone else), you need to push the branch upstream
        ```bash
        > git push -u origin my_feature
        ...
        30194fc..820b296  my-feature -> my-feature
        Branch 'my-feature' set up to track remote branch 'my-feature' from 'origin'.
        ```
    - Note that `-u` tells git to set the upstream of this branch to origin

    - This operation is needed only the first time you create the branch and
      not for each `git push`

7. Merge `master` into your feature branch regularly
    - Merge `master` into your feature branch **at least once a day**, if the branch
      stays around that long:
        ```bash
        // Get the .git from the server
        > git fetch
        // Make your master up to origin/master.
        > git checkout master
        > git pull
        // Merge master into my_feature branch.
        > git checkout my_feature
        > git merge master
        ```
    - A simpler flow which should be equivalent
        - TODO(gp): Verify that
        ```bash
        // Get the .git from the server
        > git fetch
        // Merge master into my_feature branch.
        > git checkout my_feature
        > git merge origin/master
        ```

8. Repeat Steps 4-7 as needed

9. Request a review of your work by making a pull request (PR)
   - Verify that your work is ready for a review by going through this checklist:
       - [ ] The PR is self-contained
       - [ ] The latest `master` has been merged into the feature branch
       - [ ] All files in the PR have been linted with `linter.py`
       - [ ] All tests pass
   - If your work is ready for review, make a pull request
       - Use the GitHub UI (for now; we may replace with a script).
         Go to the branch on the web interface and push "Compare & pull request"
       - Make sure that GP and Paul are assigned as reviewers, as well as
         anyone else who may be interested
       - Make sure that GP and Paul are assigned as assignees
   - Follow up on all comments and mark as resolved any requested changes that
     you resolve

# Best Practices

## Do not check in large data files
- Avoid checking in large data files
    - The reason is that large files bloat the repo
    - Once a large file is checked in, it never goes away
    - Therefore, **DO NOT CHECK IN DATA FILES IN EXCESS OF 500K**
    - If in doubt (even on a branch), ask first!
- Sometimes is makes sense to check in some representative data for unit tests
- BUT, larger tests should obtain their data from s3 or MongoDB

## Branch workflow best practices

### Branches are cheap
- One of the advantages of working with Git is that branches are cheap

### `master` is sacred
- In an ideal world `master` branch is sacred (see Platinum rule of Git)
    - Development should never be done directly on master
    - Changes to master should only happen by pull-request or merge
    - One should avoid working in master except in rare cases, e.g., a simple
      urgent bug-fix needed to unblock people
    - `master` should be always never broken (all tests are passing and it is
      deployable)

### Always work in a branch

- Generally it is best to be the sole contributor to your branch
    - If you need to collaborate with somebody on a branch, remember that the
      golden rule of rebase still applies to this "public" branch: "do not rebase
      pushed commits"

- It is ok to open multiple branches for a given task if needed
    - E.g., if you have multiple chunks of work or multiple people are working on
      orthogonal changes
    - It might be that the task is too big and needs to be broken in smaller bugs

- All the rules that apply to `master` apply also to a branch
    - E.g., commit often, use meaningful commit messages.
    - We are ok with a little looser attitude in your branch
    - E.g., it might be ok to not run unit tests before each commit, but be
      careful!

- Use a branch even if working on a research notebook
   - Try to avoid modifying notebooks in multiple branches simultaneously,
     since notebook merges can be painful
   - Working in a branch in this case facilitates review
   - Working in a branch protects the codebase from accidental pushes of code
     changes outside of the notebook (e.g., hacks to get the notebook working
     that need to be cleaned up)

### Keep different changes in separate branches

- It is easier for you to keep work sane and separated

- Cons of multiple conceptual changes in the same branches

- You are testing / debugging all at once which might make your life more
  difficult
- Reviewing unrelated changes slows down the review process
- Packaging unrelated changes together that means no change gets merged until
  **all** of the changes are accepted

## Pull request (PR) best practices

- Make sure your PR is coherent
    - It may not need to do everything the Task requires, but the PR should be
      self-contained and not break anything

- If you **absolutely** need changes under review to keep going, create the new
  branch from the old branch rather than from master (less ideal)
    - Try to avoid branching from branches
        - This creates also dependencies on the order of committing branches
        - You end up with a spiderweb of branches

- Frequent small PRs are easier to review
    - you will also experience faster review turnaround
    - reviewers like working on smaller changes more than working on larger ones
    - PR review time does not scale linearly with lines changed (may be more
      like exponential)

- Merging changes frequently means other people can more easily see how the code
  is progressing earlier on in the process, and give you feedback
    - E.g., "here it is a much simpler way of doing this", or even better "you
      donâ€™t need to write any code, just do <this_and_that>"

- Merged changes are tested in the Jenkins build

## Deleting a branch

- You can run the script `dev_scripts/git_branch.sh` to get all the branches
  together with some information, e.g., last commit and creator

- E.g., let's assume we believe that `PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket` is
  obsolete and we want to delete it

1. Get `master` up to date
    ```bash
    > git checkout master
    > git fetch
    > git pull
    ```

2. Merge `master` into the target branch
    - Pull and merge
        ```bash
        > git checkout PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket
        > git pull
        > git merge master 
        ```
    - Resolve conflicts
        ```bash
        > git commit
        > git pull
    ```

3a. Ask Git if branch is merged
    - One approach is to ask Git if all the changes in master are also in the branch
        ```bash
        > git branch `PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket` --no-merged
          PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket
        ```
    - Note that Git is very strict here, e.g., `PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket`
      is not completely merged since I've moved code "manually" (not only through
      `git cherry-pick`, `git merge`)
    - One approach is to just merge `PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket` into
      master and run `git branch` again

3b. Manually check if there is any textual difference
    - Another approach is to check what are the differences between the branch and
       `origin/master`
        ```bash
        > git log master..HEAD
        6465b0c saggese, 25 seconds ago : Merge branch 'master' into PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket  (HEAD -> PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket, origin/PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket)
        > git log HEAD..master
        ```
    - Here we see that there are no textual differences
    - So we can either merge the branch into `master` or just kill directly

4. Kill-kill-kill!
    - To delete both local and remote branch you can do
        ```bash
        > git branch -d PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket
        > git push origin --delete PartTask354_INFRA_Populate_S3_bucket
        ```

# How-to and troubleshooting

## Analyzing commits

### Show files modified in a commit
- You can see the files modified in a given commit hash with:
    ```bash
    > git show --name-only $HASH
    ```

- E.g.,
    ```bash
    > git show --name-only 39a9e335298a3fe604896fa19296d20829801cf2

    commit 39a9e335298a3fe604896fa19296d20829801cf2
    Author: Julia <julia@particle.one>
    Date:   Fri Sep 27 11:43:41 2019

        PartTask274 lint

    vendors/cme/utils.py
    vendors/first_rate/utils.py
    ```

## Conflicts

### Getting the conflicting files
- To see the files in conflicts
    ```bash
    git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
    ```
- This is what the script `git_conflict_files.sh` does

### Accepting "theirs"
```bash
> git checkout --theirs $FILES
> git add $FILES
```

ours and theirs. The first option represents the current branch from which you
executed the command before getting the conflicts, and the second option refers
to the branch where the changes are coming from.

```
> git show :1:README

> git show :2:README

> git show :3:README
```

Stage #1 is the common ancestor of the files,
stage #2 is the target-branch version,
and stage #3 is the version you are merging from.

## How to get out of a messy/un-mergeable branch

- If one screws up a branch

1) rebase to master
2) resolve the conflicts
    - E.g., pick the `master` version when needed:
        `git checkout --theirs ...; git add ...`
3) diff the changes in the branch vs another client at `master`
    ```bash
    > diff_to_vimdiff.py --dir1 $DIR1/amp --dir2 $DIR2/amp --skip_vim
    Saving log to file '/Users/saggese/src/commodity_research2/amp/dev_scripts/diff_to_vimdiff.py.log'
    10-06_15:22 INFO : _parse_diff_output:36  : Reading '/tmp/tmp.diff_to_vimdiff.txt'
    #       DIFF: README.md
    #       DIFF: core/dataflow.py
    #       DIFF: core/dataflow_core.py
    #       DIFF: core/test/test_core.py
    #       DIFF: dev_scripts/diff_to_vimdiff.py
    #       ONLY: diff_to_vimdiff.py.log in $DIR1/dev_scripts
    #       DIFF: dev_scripts/grc
    #       ONLY: code_style.txt in $DIR2/docs/notes
    ...
    #       DIFF: vendors/test/test_vendors.py
    ```
3) diff / merge manually the files that are different
    ```bash
    > diff_to_vimdiff.py --dir1 $DIR1/commodity_research2/amp --dir2 $DIR2/commodity_research3/amp --skip_vim --only_diff_content
    #       DIFF: README.md
    #       DIFF: core/dataflow.py
    #       DIFF: core/dataflow_core.py
    #       DIFF: core/test/test_core.py
    ...
    ```

## Reverting

### Reverting the last local commit
```bash
> git reset --soft HEAD~
```

## Branching

### Checking what work has been done in a branch

- Look at all the branches available:
    ```bash
    # Fetch all the data from origin.
    > git fetch
    # List all the branches.
    > git branch -r
      origin/HEAD -> origin/master
      origin/PartTask274
      ...
    ```

- Go to the branch:
    ```bash
    > git checkout PartTask274
    ```

- Check what are the commits that are in the current branch `HEAD` but not in
  `master`:
    ```bash
    > gll master..HEAD
    > git log master..HEAD
    * eb12233 Julia     PartTask274 verify dataset integrity                    (  13 hours ago) Sat Sep 28 18:55:12 2019  (HEAD -> PartTask274, origin/PartTask274)
    ...
    * a637594 saggese   PartTask274: Add tag for review                         (    3 days ago) Thu Sep 26 17:13:33 2019
    ```

- To see the actual changes in a branch you can't do (**Bad**)
    ```bash
    > git diff master..HEAD
    ```
  since `git diff` compares two commits and not a range of commits like `git log`
  (yes, Git has a horrible API)

- What you need to do is to get the first commit in the branch and the last from
  `git log` and compare them:
    ```bash
    > git difftool a637594..eb12233
    > gd a637594..eb12233
    ```

### Checking if you need to merge `master` into your feature branch

- You can see what commits are in `master` but missing in your branch with:
    ```bash
    > gll ..master
    * de51a7c saggese   Improve script to help diffing trees in case of difficult merges. Add notes from reviews (   5 hours ago) Sat Oct 5 11:24:11 2019  (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master)
    * 8acd60c saggese   Add a basic end-to-end unit test for the linter                   (  19 hours ago) Fri Oct 4 21:28:09 2019
    ...
    ```
- You want to `rebase` your feature branch onto `master`

### Comparing the difference of a directory among branches

- This is useful if we want to focus on changes on a single dir
    ```bash
    > git ll master..PartTask274 vendors/cme

    * 39a9e33 Julia     PartTask274 lint                                                  (    2 days ago) Fri Sep 27 11:43:41 2019
    * c8e7e1a Julia     PartTask268 modify according to review16                          (    2 days ago) Fri Sep 27 11:41:47 2019
    * a637594 saggese   PartTask274: Add tag for review                                   (    3 days ago) Thu Sep 26 17:13:33 2019
    ```

    ```bash
    > git diff --name-only a637594..33a46b2 -- vendors helpers
    helpers/csv.py
    vendors/cme/utils.py
    vendors/first_rate/Task274_verify_datasets.ipynb
    vendors/first_rate/Task274_verify_datasets.py
    vendors/first_rate/reader.py
    vendors/first_rate/utils.py
    vendors/test/test_vendors.py
    ```

  
## Merging `master`

    - If your branch lives long, you want to apply changes made on master to
      show on your branch
        
    - Merge flow
    
    - Assume your branch is clean
        - E.g., everything is committed, or stashed

    - Pull changes from `master` on the remote repo
        ```bash
        > git checkout master
        > git pull
        ```

    - Checkout your feature branch
        ```bash
        > git checkout my_feature
        ```

    - Merge stuff from `master` to `my_feature`
        ```bash
        > git merge master --no-ff
        ```

    ... editor will open a message for the merge commit ...

    - In few informal words, the `--no-ff` option means that commits are not
      "inlined" (similar to rebase) even if possible, but a merge commit is
      always used
        - The problem is that if the commits are "inlined" then you can't revert
          the change in one shot like we would do for a merge commit, but you
          need to revert all the inlined changes

## Rebasing
- **For now, we suggest avoiding the rebase flow**

    - The reason is that rebase makes things cleaner when used properly, but can
      get you into deep trouble if not used properly

    - You can rebase onto `master`, i.e., you re-apply your changes to
       `master`
    - Not the other way around: that would be a disaster!
        ```bash
        > git checkout my-feature
        
        // See that you have that master doesn't have.
        > > git ll origin/master..

        // See that master has that you don't have.
        > git ll ..origin/master
        
        > git rebase master

        > git ll ..origin/master
        // Now you see that there is nothing in master you don't have

        > > git ll origin/master..
        // You can see that you are ahead of master
        ```

## Merging pull requests

- The procedure for manual merges is as follows
- **Do not merge yourself unless explicitly requested by a reviewer**

1) Pull changes from remote `master` branch
    ```bash
    > git checkout master
    > git pull
    ```

2) Merge your branch into `master` without fast-forward
    ```bash
    > git merge --no-ff my-feature
    ```

3) Push the newly merged `master`
    ```bash
    > git push
    ```

4) Delete the branch, if you are done with it:
    ```bash
    > git branch -d my-feature
    ```
