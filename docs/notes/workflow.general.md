* Team synchronization points
- We understand that everybody is head-down making progress on their tasks
- This is great
- Sometimes we need coordination:
    - We need to stop the progress for a bit
    - Do a task 
    - Acknowledge that the task is done
    - Go back to pushing

- The procedure is:
    - one of us (e.g., Paul / Sergey / me) create a bug, with
        - detailed instructions
        - the list of all of the persons affected by the task

    - send a ping with the link on Telegram if the task is urgent
    - everybody does whatâ€™s asked
    - mark on the bug our name

Ok? Please ack this email replying to all.
