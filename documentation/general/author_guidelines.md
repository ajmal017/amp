# Guidelines for writing workflows

- Make no assumptions on the user
  - Nothing is obvious to somebody who doesn't know

- How to know if the process worked
  - Add sections explaining how to verify that the process completed
    successfully

- Have a trouble-shooting procedure
  - One approach is to always start from scratch

# Useful reference

- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

- [Google guide to Markdown](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md)
  - TODO(gp): Make sure it's compatible with our linter

# Style and cosmetic lints

## Use nice 80 columns formatting

- Vim has a `:gq` command to reflow the comments

## Empty line after heading

- Leave an empty line after an heading to make it more visible
  ```
  # Very important title
  - Not really important

  ## Coming through! I've big important things to do!
  - ... and his big important wheels got STUCK!
  ```

## Style for numbered lists

- We use number lists like:
  ```
  1. Foo bar!
      - hello
      - world

  2. Baz
  ```

## Using `code` style

- We use `code` style for
  - Code
  - Dirs (e.g., `/home/users`)
  - Command lines (e.g., `git push`)

- When using a block of code use the write syntax highlighting
  - Bash
    ```bash
    > git push
    ```
  - Python
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        predict_the_future()
        print("done!")
    ```

## Indenting `code` style

- GitHub / pandoc seems to render incorrectly a code block unless it's indented
  over the previous line
  - **Bad**

    ```bash
    > git push
    ```
  - **Good**
    ```bash
    > git push
    ```

## Use bullet lists

- We like using bullet list since one can represent thought process more
  clearly, e.g.,
  - This is thought #1
    - This is related to thought #1
  - This is thought #2
    - Well, that was cool!
    - But this is even better

## Improve your written English

- Use English spell-checker
  - Unfortunately this is not enough
- Type somewhere where you can use several free choices:
  - [Grammarly](www.grammarly.com),
  - [LanguageTool](https://www.languagetool.org)
  - Or other proofreading and copy-paste
- This is super-useful to improve your English since you see the error and the
  correction
  - Otherwise you will keep making the same mistakes forever

## Make sure your markdown looks good

- You can:
  - Check in a branch and use GitHub to render it
  - Use pycharm to edit, which also renders it side-by-side

## Table of content (TOC)

### Markdown TOC

- Unfortunately both markdown and GitHub don't support automatically generating
  a TOC for a document
- We work around this problem using a script that post-process the markdown
  adding links to create a TOC

### To insert a TOC

- Add the tags at the beginning of the markdown file
- Note that in the text below we interspersed spaces to avoid the TOC processor
  to add a table of content also here:

  ```markdown
  < ! - - t s - - >

  < ! - - t e - - >
  ```

### To update all markdown files

- Run:
  ```bash
  > documentation/scripts/lint_md.sh
  ```

### Script installation

- To install the script follow the instructions
  [here](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc):

  ```python
  > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc/master/gh-md-toc
  > chmod +x gh-md-toc
  > mv gh-md-toc documents/scripts
  ```

- We have installed it in the repo but the script might need to be updated once
  in a while
