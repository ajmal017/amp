2. During the process we want to:
  - First of all is to give tools for interaction with the team. 
  During the process a new guy will ask questions and he should be able to do 
  this through the common tools. Email, Telegramm, Issues.
  - Force a new guy to interact through the issues that is why we asking him to 
  create his firs issue about his experience with the process. He should put
  his notes in this issue while he moving during this process. We use his 
  experience to improve our workflow.
