2. During the process we want to:

-   Provide tools for interacting with the team. During the process the new guy
    will ask questions and he should be able to do this using the tools: Email,
    Telegramm, Issues.
-   We force anew hire to operate through the tools
    -   That is why we asking him to create his first issue about his experience
        with the process.
    -   He should put his notes in this issue while he moving during this
        process.
    -   We use his experience to improve our workflow.
