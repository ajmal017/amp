## During the process we want to:

-   Provide tools for interacting with the team. During the process the new
    teammate will ask questions and he should be able to do this using the
    tools: - email - Telegram - GitHub issues
-   We want to nudge a new hire to operate through the tools
    -   That is why we asking him to create his first issue about his experience
        with the process.
    -   He should put his / her notes in the GH issue while proceeding during
        the on-boarding process.
    -   We want to use each new team-member experience to improve our workflow.
