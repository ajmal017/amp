# Tools

## Editors

- PyCharm
- `vim` (or something worse like `emacs`)

## Development / Data science

- Python 3
- Linux and bash: we prefer command line: learn how to use it
- Git: source control
- GitHub: repo and bug tracker
- ZenHub: project management
- Chrome (recommended) or Firefox: browser
- Google docs and markdown: documentation
- Google suite: email, calendar
- Email client (recommended) or Gmail web client
- Telegram: instant messaging
- Standard data science stack (e.g., Jupyter, pandas, numpy)

## Infra

- WireGuard: VPN
- AWS: computing infrastructure
- Jenkins: continuous integration and development
- MongoDB, SQL: DB backends
- Docker: container

# Set up a new machine

## Server vs laptop

- We prefer to work on the dev server on AWS since it is more reliable and
  powerful

- You have an option to work on your laptop, but it's not officially supported,
  so you are kind of your own
  - People use their laptop as thin client:
    - Use PyCharm
    - Use the browser, email
    - To develop when Internet is slow

- You need to set up any machine you use (e.g., laptop and AWS) in order to
  develop

- We recommend to set up the server first and then over time set up also the
  laptop for some development

## Definitions

- We refer to Git repos in the following way:
  - `alphamatic/amp` as `//amp`

## Connect to the server

- After enabling the VPN on your laptop, open a terminal
- Make sure you see the servers:

  ```bash
  > ping research
  PING research (172.31.16.23): 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from 172.31.16.23: icmp_seq=0 ttl=63 time=19.780 ms
  ...
  ```

- Try to connect to the servers:
  ```bash
  > ssh research
  ```
- Best course of action is to pass your public key to Infra so that you can
  login without typing in a password

## Use python3

- Confirm that python 3 is the default upon running `python -V`, e.g.,
  ```bash
  > python -V
  Python 3.7.3
  ```

# Create a Git client

## Clone the git code

- You can clone the code multiple times in different directories, if you want to
  have multiple clients
  - E.g., `$HOME/src/...1`, `$HOME/src/...2`, ...
- For now let's create a single client

- To clone the code for the first time run:

  ```bash
  > DST_DIR="..."
  > git clone --recursive git@github.com:.../....git $DST_DIR
  ```

- If you encounter the error

  ```bash
  bash git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

  Please make sure you have the correct access rights
  and the repository exists.
  ```

  make sure that your SSH key in `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is on your GitHub
  account. Follow the instructions
  [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

- If you have problems run
  ```bash
  > ssh -T git@github.com
  ```
  and follow this
  [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/testing-your-ssh-connection)

## Configure git submodules

- Make sure you have submodule (e.g., `amp`) by running:

  ```bash
  > cd $DST_DIR
  > ls amp
  ```

- Make sure each submodule uses the `master` branch:
  ```bash
  > cd $DST_DIR
  > (cd amp; git checkout master)
  ```

## Configure user credentials

- Once you receive access key ID and secret access key run `aws configure` to
  generate aws config files:
  - Install aws client on your machine
  - Run
    ```bash
    > aws configure
    ```
  - Specify access key ID and secret access key
  - You may leave the default region name and default output format unassigned
  - Check that the `config` and `credentials` files have been created:
    ```bash
    > ls ~/.aws
    ```

## Clone multiple git client

- To check out another copy of the codebase (e.g., see possible workflows below)
  do:
  ```bash
  > more dev_scripts/git_checkout.sh
  #!/bin/bash -xe
  DST_DIR="..."
  git clone --recursive git@github.com:.../....git $DST_DIR
  ```

# Workflow examples

## Working with multiple clients

- Different people have different set-ups that reflect their workflows

## A simple set-up

- Always work from the Git repo `//Part`, typically `...`
- You might need to `cd` back and forth between the two repos `//Part` and
  `//Amp`

## GP's set-up

- My set-up is a bit on the complicated side:
  - I like to have multiple clients (a residual behavior from subversion that
    doesn't allow to switch clients as quickly as Git)
  - One client is always at `master`
  - One client for checking out branches to do reviews
  - One client for development

- Two Git clients `...1` and `...2`
  - One for development
  - One for review CLs
- One terminal window per Git client
  - (So I can switch easily between Git clients)
- One Pycharm project for each Git client
  - To edit the code
- One tmux session in each terminal with:
  - (So I can switch easily between dirs of the project)
  - One shell cd-ed in `...*`
  - One shell running jupyter
  - One shell cd-ed `...*/amp`
  - See details `//amp/dev_scripts/tmux.sh`

## Run jupyter notebook

- Launch jupyter notebook on the server:
  - Everyone chooses which port to use.
  - Running notebook without a tmux session will stop as soon as you leave the
    server.
  - If you want to have a constantly running notebook, create a tmux session.
    - `tmux` - Create tmux session.
    - `tmux a` - Connect to the last session.
    - Leave/detach the tmux session by typing `Ctrl+b` and `then d`.
  - Example run notebook:
    - IP - You can allow all addresses, but we expect you to use the internal
      server addresses(Example: 172.31.16.23).
    - PORT - use your port instead of a variable {PORT}(Example: 8088).
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook --ip=172.31.16.23 --port 8088
  ```
