- `all@particle.one` is the mailing list with everybody at the company

- We send notifications for commits and other services (e.g., Jenkins) to
  `git@particle.one`
    - TODO(gp): Maybe it should be a more general `dev@particle.one` ?

- A GitHub user `infraparticleone` is used to check out code for services (e.g.,
  Jenkins, ReviewBoard)
