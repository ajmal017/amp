- `all@particle.one` is the mailing list with everybody at the company

- We send notifications for commits and other services (e.g., Jenkins) to
  `git@particle.one`
    - TODO(gp): Maybe it should be a more general `dev@particle.one` ?

- A GitHub user `infraparticleone` is used to check out code for services (e.g.,
  Jenkins, ReviewBoard)

# Anatomy of email messages from infra

- The goal is to classify emails so that we can filter email effectively

# Email flow

https://help.github.com/en/categories/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github

- I prefer to use filters on the gmail (server) side
    - pros
        - I don't get emails on my cellphone continuously
        - the emails are organized as they arrive
        - folders are on the server side, so my client can simply sync
    - cons
        - gmail interface for filtering emails is horrible

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox -> saggese@gmail.com
    /#settings/filters
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox -> gp@particle.one
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/5/#inbox -> gp@alphamatic.llc

## Issue activity

    - `subscribed@noreply.github.com` -> General GH bug activity (when the issue is opened)
    - `your_activity@noreply.github.com` -> Your GH bug activity
    - `comment@noreply.github.com` -> Comment on GH bug not from you
- The email looks like:
    ```
    GP Saggese <notifications@github.com>
    to
        ParticleDev/commodity_research (commodity_research@noreply.github.com),
        me (saggese@gmail)
        Your (your_activity@noreply.github.com)

    A TOC (table of contents) for our md documentation might help navigating it, since it's not easy to have a view of the high level structure.

    A solution that seems pretty simple is here
