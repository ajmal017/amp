# Connecting Google Sheets to Pandas


In order to load a google sheet into a pandas dataframe (or the other way around), one can use a library called `gpread-pandas`.  


# Installing gspread-pandas


The detailed instructions on how to install the library are located here: [Installation/Usage](https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation-usage).


Client credentials need to be generated by each user independently. The instructions are provided [here](https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#client-credentials).

Some pointers:
- Make sure to act only under your `particle.one` account.
- Project/product/application names don't really matter. It's convenient to pick a name connected to Particle (e.g. ParticleApp) so that it's easy to find later.
- Whenever you are given a choice of making something generally accessible or accessible only to the members of your organization, choose making it accessible only to the members of your organization.
- When you are given a choice of time periods to create something for, choose the longest one.
- When you are given a choice between `OAuth client ID` and `Service account`, choose `OAuth client ID`.

To use the library on the server, the downloaded JSON with the credentials needs to be stored at `/wd/{your_username}/.config/gspread_pandas/google_secret.json`.


# Using gspread-pandas


The notebook with the usage example is located at `core/notebooks/gsheet_into_pandas_example.ipynb`.

The official usage documentation is provided [here](https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html).


The first time the library is used, it will asks the user for an authorization code.

After the authorization code is provided for the first time, it won't be asked again.
